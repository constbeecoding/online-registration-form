# Techdegree-Project-Three
 An Online Registration Form Project


## Updates 
V. 2 - 07-2021 Refactoring CSS into SCSS. Making the form more accessible by removing the Anaglyph font effect from the Legend, and Header. Added focus effects to inputs and text areas. Increased font size and made it more responsive using rem units.

## Strengths
V. 1 - First time using an API Google Font Effect and I love how simple it is to add some spicy design to a project.

### Learning Moments
I put normalize at the **bottom** of the stylesheets. **facepalm**

I learned a lot about how flexbox functions. Including having two parent containers. *thank you John Skeen of Treehouse!*
